# Restaurant-OdinProject
A restaurant page made using node modules, webpack, and html-webpack-plugin. Utilized dynamic loading of elements using javascript.


Elements are loaded dynamically through javascript. The page follows a tabbed approach, by pressing the different tabs different content is displayed on the card.

I did not add styling because it would take too much of my time.
